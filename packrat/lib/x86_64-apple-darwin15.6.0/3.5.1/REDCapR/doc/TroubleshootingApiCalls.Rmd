Troubleshooting REDCap API Calls
==================================================================

There are many links in the pipeline between your institution's [REDCap](http://www.project-redcap.org/) server and the API user.  When the end result is unsuccessful, this document should help narrow the location of the possible problem.  The first two sections will be relevant to almost any language interacting with the API.  The remaining sections are possibly relevant only to your language (eg, Python, R, SAS, bash), or your software library ([redcapAPI](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI) and [REDCapR](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR) in R and [PyCap](http://pycap.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) in Python).

Server Configuration and Authorization
------------------------------------------------------------------

This first group of checks primarily focuses on the server and the logins accounts.  Unlike later sections, REDCap administrator privileges are necessary for most of these checks.

1. **Does the user have an account for the *server*?**  This can be verified in the `Browse Users` section of the server's `Control Center`.

1. **Does the user have permissions for the specific *project*?** This can be verified in the `User Rights` section within the project.  Notice that it's possible (but ultimately not useful) to have an account here, but not with the server, so don't skip the previous step.

1. **Can the user log in normally through the interface?** However if the username and password aren't working, the API theoretically might still work because it uses their token instead of their password.

1. **Has the user verified their account by responding to the automated email sent to them?** This can be verified in the `Browse Users` section of your server's `Control Center`.  For each email address they've entered, there should be a green 'Verified' label and icon.

1. **Has the user been granted the desired import and/or export permissions?** This can be verified in the `User Rights` section or in the `API` section (and it's `Manage All Project Tokens` tab) within the project.  Alternatively, it can be verified in the `API Tokens` section of the server's `Control Center`.

1. **Are they using the correct token?** This can be verified in the `API` section (and it's `Manage All Project Tokens` tab) within the project.  Click the magnifying glass icon in the user's row.  Alternatively, it can be verified in the `API Tokens` section of the server's `Control Center`.

Language Agnostic API
------------------------------------------------------------------

This section group examines potential problems that occur after it leaves a working server, but before it is handled by their programming language (eg, Python and R).  [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/) is a Chrome plugin recommended by [several](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/project-redcap/postman/project-redcap/eYK_SLzW2k4/0hmf8vWLpdAJ) [people](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/project-redcap/postman/project-redcap/RdLeRFGqzbg/WgdjTBLph1kJ) that makes troubleshooting much more efficient.

1. **Is Postman installed and operating correctly?**  
 If it helps to start with a different REDCap server, you can use this dummy project containing fake data hosted by the [OUHSC BBMC](http://ouhsc.edu/bbmc/).  The url is `https://bbmc.ouhsc.edu/redcap/api/`.  There are three key-value pairs: (1) the 'token' is `9A81268476645C4E5F03428B8AC3AA7B`, (2) the 'content' is `record`, and (3) the 'format' should be `CSV`.  When checking your own server, the token value should change, but the content and format should not.  It should return five records in a CSV format.  The 'status' should be `200 OK`.  The result should look roughly like this.  Notice the line breaks were included in the text values themselves.

    ```

1. **Can an administrator query the API successfully with Postman with the admin token?** As an administrator, create an account for yourself, and verify that your token works on your server and project.
  
1. **Can an administrator query the API successfully with Postman with the user's token?** Use [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/) as before, but replace your token with the user's token.  Once the whole problem is solved, reissue new API tokens to both you and the user.

1. **Can an user query the API successfully with Postman with the their own token?** The values they enter should be exactly the same as those entered in the previous step.  A failure here (assuming the previous step was successful) suggests a network or firewall issue.  If the server is behind your institution's firewall, verify the user is connecting successfully through the VPN.

1. **Can a user query the API with cURL?**  [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) is a command line tool that's underneath a lot of libraries.  If it's installed correctly on your location machine, it can be executed from the terminal or command line.
    ```shell
    curl -X POST -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -F "token=9A81268476645C4E5F03428B8AC3AA7B" -F "content=record" -F "format=csv" "https://bbmc.ouhsc.edu/redcap/api/"
    ```

Exporting from REDCap to R
------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several ways to call REDCap's API from [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).  The packages [redcapAPI](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI) and [REDCapR](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR) both rely on the [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=httr) package, which calls the [curl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=curl) package.
 
1. **Is httr installed on the user's local machine?** If so, running `library(httr)` should not produce any error messages if you're starting with a fresh session of R:

    ```r
    > library(httr)
    ``` 

1. **Does the user have the most recent version of httr?** There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is probably to run `update.packages(ask=FALSE, repos="http://cran.rstudio.com")`.  The optional argument `ask` prevents the user from needing to respond 'Y' to each outdated package.
 
1. **Can the user query a *test* project using httr?** Both the [redcapAPI](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI) and [REDCapR](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR) packages employ something similar to the following function in [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=httr).  If you're curious, here is the relevant source code for [redcapAPI](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI/blob/master/R/exportRecords.R) and [REDCapR](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/blob/master/R/redcap-read-oneshot.R).

    If this check fails, consider attempting again with the uri and token used above in the Postman example.

    This check avoids checking the SSL certificate in order to simplify the troubleshooting.  SSL verification is supported by default in the [PyCap](http://pycap.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), [redcapAPI](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI), and [REDCapR](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR) packages.

    ```r
    redcap_uri <- "https://bbmc.ouhsc.edu/redcap/api/"
    token      <- "9A81268476645C4E5F03428B8AC3AA7B"
    
    raw_text <- RCurl::postForm(
      uri                         = redcap_uri
      , token                     = token
      , content                   = 'record'
      , format                    = 'csv'
      , type                      = 'flat'
      , rawOrLabel                = 'raw'
      , exportDataAccessGroups    = 'true'
      , .opts                     = RCurl::curlOptions(ssl.verifypeer=FALSE)
    )
    ```  

    Alternatively, you can try using the [`httr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=httr) package, which uses `RCurl` underneath.  [`REDCapR`](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR) and a recent fork of [`redcap`](https://github.com/nutterb/redcap) actually uses `httr` directly, instead of `RCurl`.  As of 2014-07-06, this works with the Windows 8 version for [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) (which is underneath `RCurl), but not with some Linux versions; in this case pass the location of the SSL cert file.

    ```r
    post_body <- list(
      token                       = token,
      content                     = 'record',
      format                      = 'csv',
      type                        = 'flat',
      rawOrLabel                  = 'raw',
      exportDataAccessGroups      = 'true'
    )
    
    raw_text <- httr::POST(
      url                         = redcap_uri,
      body                        = post_body,
      config                      = httr::config(ssl.verifypeer=FALSE),
      httr::verbose() #Remove this line to suppress the frequent console updates.
    )
    ```

1. **Can the user query a *subset* of *their* project using RCurl?** This step is like the previous one, but with two differences.  First, it's using their REDCap project (instead of the test project).  Second, it pulls fewer records, and a smaller collection of fields.  Subsetting can help troubleshoot by avoiding (and thus identifying) cells with problematic values.  

    Notice this call to `RCurl::postForm()` now passes values to the `records` and `fields` parameters.  Also notice the value is a *single* long string, rather a *vector* of shorter strings (which is more natural to most R users).

    ```r
    redcap_uri         <- "https://the.urlofyourinsitution.edu/api/" 
    token              <- "your-secret-token"                        
    records_collapsed  <- "1,2,3"                             # Assumes dataset contains ID values of 1-3.
    fields_collapsed   <- "record_id,name_first,name_last"    # Assumes dataset contains these variables.
    
    raw_text <- RCurl::postForm(
      uri                          = redcap_uri
      , token                      = token
      , content                    = 'record'
      , format                     = 'csv'
      , type                       = 'flat'
      , rawOrLabel                 = 'raw'
      , exportDataAccessGroups     = 'true'
      , records                    = records_collapsed
      , fields                     = fields_collapsed
      , .opts                      = RCurl::curlOptions(ssl.verifypeer=FALSE)
    )
    ``` 

1. **Can the user query an *entire* project using RCurl?** There are two advantages of trying a subset of the data.  First, small datasets avoid the time-out errors that plague large datasets.  Second, it may avoid problematic values being passed through the pipeline.  If the current check fails but the previous check succeedes, then experiment with different expanses of records and fields.  This should help determine which values are causing the problems, or if there's simply too much data being pulled in one pass.
 
    If the desired dataset is too large, consider if you can prune unnecessary records or fields.  If not, one solution is to pull smaller, multiple batches using the API, then reassemble them.  The `redcap_read()` function in [REDCapR](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/blob/master/documentation-peek.pdf) does this automatically, and allows the user to specify a `batch_size`.
 
    ```r
    redcap_uri                  <- "https://the.urlofyourinsitution.edu/api/" 
    token                       <- "your-secret-token"
    records_collapsed           <- NULL
    fields_collapsed            <- NULL
    
    raw_text <- RCurl::postForm(
      uri                        = redcap_uri
      , token                    = token
      , content                  = 'record'
      , format                   = 'csv'
      , type                     = 'flat'
      , rawOrLabel               = 'raw'
      , exportDataAccessGroups   = 'true'
      , records                  = records_collapsed
      , fields                   = fields_collapsed
      , .opts                    = RCurl::curlOptions(ssl.verifypeer=FALSE)
    )
    ```

Exporting from REDCap to R, using REDCapR
------------------------------------------------------------------

[REDCapR](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR) is a package that uses [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) (via [httr](https://github.com/hadley/httr)) to communicate with REDCap, and wraps convenience functions around it to reduce the size and complexity of the user's code.  The package's basic functions are demonstrated in [this vignette](https://cdn.rawgit.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/master/inst/doc/BasicREDCapROperations.html) and are documented in its [reference manual](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/blob/master/documentation-peek.pdf) (click the 'View Raw' link).

If you're not using REDCapR, you can skip this section and proceed to 'Importing into REDCap from R' below.

1. **Is REDCapR installed on the user's machine?** Currently the easiest way to install REDCapR is with the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).  The follow code installs devtools, then installs REDCapR.
    ```r
    install.packages("devtools", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com")
    devtools::install_github(repo="OuhscBbmc/REDCapR")
    ```

1. **Does REDCapR load successfully on the user's machine?** If so, running `library(REDCapR)` should produce the following output if you're starting with a fresh session of R:
    ```r
    library(REDCapR)
    ## Loading required package: REDCapR
    ```

1. **Can the user export from an example project?** This is the same fake data hosted by the [OUHSC BBMC](http://ouhsc.edu/bbmc/) as in the previous section.
    ```r
    library(REDCapR) #Load the package into the current R session.
    uri   <- "https://bbmc.ouhsc.edu/redcap/api/"
    token <- "9A81268476645C4E5F03428B8AC3AA7B"
    redcap_read(redcap_uri=uri, token=token)$data
    ```

    The previous code should produce similar output.  Notice there are five rows and the columns will wrap around if your console window is too narrow.
    ```
    5 records and 1 columns were read from REDCap in 0.41 seconds.

1. **Can the user export from their own project?** The code is similar to the previous check, but the `uri` and `token` values will need to be modified.
    ```r
    library(REDCapR) #Load the package into the current R session, if you haven't already.
    redcap_uri       <- "https://the.urlofyourinsitution.edu/api/"
    token            <- "your-secret-token"
    redcap_read(redcap_uri=uri, token=token)$data
    ```

    Alternatively, a `redcap_project` object can be declared initially, which makes subsequent calls cleaner when the token and url are required only the when the object is declared.
    ```r
    library(REDCapR) #Load the package into the current R session, if you haven't already.
    uri               <- "https://bbmc.ouhsc.edu/redcap/api/"
    token             <- "9A81268476645C4E5F03428B8AC3AA7B"  
    project           <- redcap_project$new(redcap_uri=uri, token=token)
    
    ds_three_columns  <- project$read(fields=c("record_id", "sex", "age"))$data
    
    ids_of_males      <- ds_three_columns$record_id[ds_three_columns$sex==1]
    ids_of_minors     <- ds_three_columns$record_id[ds_three_columns$age < 18]
    
    ds_males          <- project$read(records=ids_of_males, batch_size=2)$data
    ds_minors         <- project$read(records=ids_of_minors)$data
    ```

1. **Is the export operation still unsuccessful using REDCapR?**
 If so the "Can the user query a *entire* REDCap project using RCurl?" check succeeded, but the REDCapR checks did not, consider posting a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/issues) to the package developers.

Exporting from REDCap to R, using redcapAPI
------------------------------------------------------------------

[redcapAPI](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI) is a package that uses [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) (via [httr](https://github.com/hadley/httr)) to communicate with REDCap, and wraps convenience functions around it to reduce the size and complexity of the user's code.  

If you're not using redcapAPI, you can skip this section and proceed to 'Importing into REDCap from R' below.  More specific discussion about `redcapAPI` can be found at the [package's wiki](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI/wiki).

1. **Is redcapAPI installed on the user's machine?** Currently, the easiest way to install `redcapAPI` is from CRAN.
    ```r
    install.packages("redcapAPI")
    ```
 
    Developmental versions may be available on GitHub.
    ```r
    install.packages("devtools", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com")
    devtools::install_github(repo="nutterb/redcapAPI")
    ```

1. **Does redcapAPI load successfully on the user's machine?** If so, running `library(redcapAPI)` should produce the following output if you're starting with a fresh session of R:
    ```r
    library(redcapAPI)
    ## Loading required package: redcapAPI
    ```

1. **Can the user export from an example project?** This is the same fake data hosted by the [OUHSC BBMC](http://ouhsc.edu/bbmc/) as in the previous section.
    ```r
    library(redcapAPI) #Load the package into the current R session.
    rcon <- redcapConnection(
      url   = "https://bbmc.ouhsc.edu/redcap/api/",
      token = "9A81268476645C4E5F03428B8AC3AA7B"
    )
    exportRecords(rcon)
    ```

    The previous code should produce similar output.  Notice there are five rows and the columns will wrap around if your console window is too narrow.

1. **Can the user export from their own project?** The code is similar to the previous check, but the `uri` and `token` values will need to be modified.
    ``` r
    library(redcapAPI) #Load the package into the current R session, if you haven't already.
    rcon <- redcapConnection(
      url   = "https://the.urlofyourinsitution.edu/api/", # Adapt this to your server.
      token = "your-secret-token"                         # Adapt this to your user's token.
    ) 
    exportRecords(rcon)
    ```

1. **Is the export operation still unsuccessful using redcapAPI?** If so the "Can the user query a *entire* REDCap project using RCurl?" check succeeded, but the redcapAPI checks did not, consider posting a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI/issues) to the package developers.


Importing into REDCap from R
------------------------------------------------------------------

Troubleshooting import operations is trickier than export operations for two major reasons.  First, the database potentially persists your *import* mistakes.  In contrast, repeatedly *exporting* data won't affect subsequent reads.  Considering cloning the REDCap project for testing until the problem is resolved.  Remember to create a new token (because they're not automatically created when projects are cloned, even when users are copied), and to modify your code's token to point to the new testing clone.

 The second reason why importing can be trickier is because the schema (eg, the names and data types) of your local dataset must match the project's schema.  This section will be expanded in the future.  Current recommendations include checking if you can write to simpler projects (perhaps with 1 ID field and 1 string field), and progressively moving to mimic the problematic project's schema and dataset.  Also, consider exporting the dataset to your machine, and look for differences.  Note that you cannot import calculated fields into REDCap.

1. **Can the user import the *entire* project?**

1. **Can the user import a *subset* of the project?**
